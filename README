This is a very simple search engine for the data of the treebank that
is going to become part of the Narodowy Korpus JÄ™zyka Polskiego
(www.nkjp.pl).  It can be used to find nodes in the syntactic
trees of natural language sentences of the corpus, which posess some
or all of the properties indicated in the search query given.  Search
queries are given by the web user in the TIGERSearch-like query
language.  The user may search for a single node possessing some
property, a group of nodes (a subforest) that stand in some relation,
an entire tree or an entire forest of possible derivation trees.

The main dependencies for running the search engine currently are:
 * a treebank in a format compatible with that of NKJP,
 * postgresql >= 8.4 (tested with 8.4.8)
 * python 3 (tested with 3.1.3)
 * psycopg2 (tested with 2.4.2)
 * ply (tested with 3.4)

The postgresql administrator will need to create a database named 'treebank'
with hstore and plpgsql support and assign create rights to the user who
will run the import script, and assign select rights to the user that
will run the server script.  (The easiest way to do that is to make that
user the database owner.)  Example:

# su - postgres
$ psql <<< "CREATE DATABASE treebank WITH owner = joehacker encoding = 'UNICODE' template = template0;"
$ createlang plpgsql treebank
$ psql -d treebank -f /usr/share/postgresql-8.4/contrib/hstore.sql
